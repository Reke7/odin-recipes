    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ribeye steak, seasoned salt, and pepper are all you need for a perfectly grilled steak. Make sure your briquettes are red hot.</p>
    <p>These are the simple ingredients you’ll need to make steak on a charcoal grill:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak: This recipe was developed using a 12-ounce ribeye steak that was 1-inch thick. If your steak is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the cook time.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: The charcoal-grilled steak is simply seasoned with seasoned salt and cracked black pepper. Of course, you can tweak the seasonings to suit your taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the steak on both sides.</li>
        <li>Light the charcoal briquettes, then place the steak on the grates when they’re red hot.</li>
        <li>Grill on both sides until the steak is cooked to your preferred doneness.</li>
        <li>Tent with aluminum foil and let rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
